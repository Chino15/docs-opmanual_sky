# Safety {#build-safety status=ready}

The goal of this section is to identify sources of danger in the drone build, and to provide safety guidelines to mitigate the chance of harm.

## Soldering

A majority of the drone build involves soldering. Soldering is fun and safe when done with proper care; however, the soldering iron is **very** hot, and is a significant burn hazard. By products of soldering are also dangerous-- the fumes produced from the flux evaporating, as well as handling the solder itself because it may contain lead. Be sure to follow the following safety guidelines whenever soldering:

- Solder in a well ventilated space and use a fume extractor to suck the fumes away from you while working

-  Always wear safety goggles when soldering to prevent solder from splashing into your eyes, and to help keep the solder fumes away from your eyes

- Make sure the soldering iron stand is sturdy-- the soldering iron can sit in the stand without falling falling over-- before plugging in the soldering iron

- Never touch the metal part of the soldering iron after it has been plugged in

- If you are feeling light-headed after soldering for extended periods of time, take a break and get fresh air

- Wash your hands after soldering since the solder may contain lead
