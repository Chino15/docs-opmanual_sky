# Phase 0: Prep Work {#part:build-assignment-X status=ready}

## Preface

Before you begin this phase, please ensure you have all the parts in the [parts and materials list]().

In this phase of the build, you will do prep work for the next phases of the build. This phase will require a lot of soldering, so please go through a [soldering tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qps9woUGkvI) before starting.

Safety tips:
- Be careful holding wires and components with your bare hands while soldering, as they will get very hot very quickly. We recommend using a long-nose plier or helping hands whenever possible.
- Don't touch the soldering iron tip (or any other metal piece) while the soldering iron is on, since doing so can cause burns. If you get burned, rinse the affected area with cold water immediately.
- Likewise, don't use the soldering iron on anything you don't intend to solder. The high heat will cause things to melt or burn.
- Don't breathe soldering fumes; use a soldering fan whenever possible. Although lead-free solder isn't harmful, it can still make you nauseous.
- If you have difficulty soldering (e.g. shaky hands), please seek the advise of a TA or teacher.
