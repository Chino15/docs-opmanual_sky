# Phase 0: Prep Work {#part:build-assignment-X status=ready}
Expected Time: 3.5 hours

## Preface

Before you begin, please ensure you have all the parts in the [parts and materials list]().

In this phase of the build, you will do prep work for the next phases of the build. This phase will require a lot of soldering, so please go through a [soldering tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qps9woUGkvI) before starting.

Safety tips:
- Be careful holding wires and components with your bare hands while soldering, as they will get very hot very quickly. We recommend using a long-nose plier or helping hands whenever possible.
- Don't touch the soldering iron tip (or any other metal piece) while the soldering iron is on, since doing so can cause burns. If you get burned, rinse the affected area with cold water immediately.
- Likewise, don't use the soldering iron on anything you don't intend to solder. The high heat will cause things to melt or burn.
- Don't breathe soldering fumes; use a soldering fan whenever possible.
- If you have difficulty soldering (e.g. shaky hands), please seek the advise of a TA or teacher.

## Stripping and Tinning Wires
**Stripping** is the process of removing a portion of insulator from a wire in order to expose its strands. It is done by using a wire stripper.

**Tinning** is the process of coating exposed wire with solder. It is done by using a soldering iron to melt solder onto exposed wire.

The purpose of stripping and tinning wires is to allow them to be joined together. By itself, stripping would not allow wires to be joined because the exposed wires would have no way to "stick" to each other:

However, tinning *does* allow exposed wires to "stick" (i.e. join) to each other; Since solder turns into a liquid when exposed to high heat, but back to a solid when heat is removed, wires can be joined by:
1. Putting the tinned wires next to each other (so they are touching)

2. Heating the solder on both wires simultaneously so each turns into a liquid blob. The liquid blobs will then combine into a larger liquid blob.

3. Removing the heat so the larger liquid blob solidifies, thus joining the two wires.

Furthermore, since solder is conductive, the resulting joint acts as a bridge for electricity traveling between the connected wires!

**Your task**, then, is to strip and tin all of your parts so that they can be joined together in the next phases:
- ESCs

- Motors

- BEC (NOTE: only tin black and red wires on the IN side of BEC)

- Red and brown wire pair in flight controller box (NOTE: do **not** substitute with another wire pair in the box)

## Creating an XT60 Connector Cable
Please skip this step if your kit already contains a completed XT60 connector cable:

1. Gather the following parts:
    - XT60 connector (Female)
    - Protective casing for XT60 connector (optional)
    - 12AWG black wire, 12AWG red wire

2. Follow this [guide](http://www.mindsensors.com/blog/how-to/tutorial-soldering-xt60-connectors) on creating an XT60 connector cable.
3. Attach the protective casing by sliding it into place (optional).
4. Strip and tin your completed XT60 connector cable.
