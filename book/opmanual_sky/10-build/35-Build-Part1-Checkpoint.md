# Part 1 Checkpoint {#build-part1-checkpoint status=ready}

**Expected Time**: 10 minutes

## Connect to the Pi for the first time

You will now verify that the SD card is working properly by connecting to your Pi for the first time. The SD card is configured to serve a text editor that gives you access to all of the files on the Pi. You won't be making any changes at this point, you will just be verifying that you can connect to the server.

1) Plug the battery into the  XT60 connector

2) On your base station, connect to the wifi network called **defaultdrone**. The wifi password is **bigbubba**

Note: At this point you will lose internet access, because you will be connected to the Pi's network. You can disconnect and reconnect to the network at any point without causing issues on the Pi.

3) In a web browser on your base station, [follow this link](http://duckiesky-drone.local:8081/?folder=/home/duckiesky/ws/src/pidrone_pkg)

4) If the link does not show an error, then your SD card is correctly flashed! You can browse around the text editor and files if you'd like. You will be learning more about this interface in a later lesson.

Congrats on finishing Build Part 1!
