# Phase 4: Asssembly {#build-phase4 status=ready}

**Expected Time**: 30 minutes

## Preface

In this section of the build, you will complete the final assembly of your drone.

## Glue USB Connector to Flight Controller

Carefully plug the 6" USB cable into the USB port of the skyline. These 
little surface-mount USB micro ports are very prone to failure, so to minimize 
the likelyhood of ripping off the port or breaking a connection cover the USB connector 
thoroughly with hot glue. 
Yes, you will not be able to remove the USB cable. This is intentional.
