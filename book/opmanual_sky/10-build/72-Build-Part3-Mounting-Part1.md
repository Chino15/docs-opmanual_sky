## Attaching Motors and ESC 

### Attaching to Frame
We're going to begin by attaching the arms to the bottom platform. The bottom platform should have the PDB already attached to it. 


Layer the arm with the Bottomr and Sandwich Platforms as shown below.

Using 16 12mm screws and 16 M3 nuts, secure the layered arms and sandwich platform. See picture below.

Now, we can attach the motors to the arms. We'll need to layer the arms with the propeller guards as well. 

Layer the arms and the propeller guards as shown below.

Use the long M3 bolts (included with the motors) and the hex key to secure the motors to the layered arms and propeller guards.

Note: Align the motors so the wires point towards the frame.

Lastly, we can connect the ESC's.
