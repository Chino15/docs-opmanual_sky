# Introduction {#build-assignment status=ready}

It is said that robotics is the decathlon of computer science. To build a
functioning robot involves sweeping areas of hardware and software: systems
to manage the many programs running on a robot, networking to facilitate
communication between various nodes in the system, algorithms to compute
efficiently within very limiting computational constraints, and of course
hardware itself, which limits all aspects of the robot's behavior. You can write
as much fancy code as you want, but if your CPU overheats, then the robot isn't
going anywhere!
