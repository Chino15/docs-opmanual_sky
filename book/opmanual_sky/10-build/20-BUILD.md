# Build {#build-assignment-1 status=ready}

The goal of this project is to build your drone and test it with the solution code. Parts necessary for the build are provided in your kit. In addition, you will need a base station (i.e. personal computer) in order to control the drone.

## Base Station
You will need a base station to connect to the drone and give it commands. Any Mac, GNU/Linux, or Windows OS will be sufficient. If you are a Brown student taking the course and do not have such a basestation, talk to us and we will provide one that you can borrow for the semester.

## Where to work
You are free to work on this project wherever and whenever you like! We recommend resources like the Brown Design Workshop, CIT121, and the Internet of Things lab on the 8th floor of the SciLi (where hours are held). Communal parts, tools, and guidance will be available in the Internet of Things (IoT) lab during open hours 1pm - 8pm weekdays and during office hours and lab hours.

## Checkoff
Throughout the project are checkoff points where you will come show us your drone. You can come to office hours to get checked off, and we will also provide special lab hours for checkoff and help with the project.

We will check the following things:

  * Solder joins. (Shorts? Mechanical failure?)
  * Motors are correct orientation.
  * Camera in the right spot.
  * IR in the right spot.
